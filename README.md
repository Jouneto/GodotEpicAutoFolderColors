## Mentioned Extra Steps (temporary):
1. In "Epic Debug Panel" (at bottom panel):
    1. Select color options
    2. Click "Manual Change Folder Colors" button to change colors
2. Wait for "The following files are newer on disk: project.godot" popup (alt+tab'ing works)
3. Click "Reload from disk"
4. In "Epic Debug Panel" click "Refresh File System" button to see changes (or alternativly just refresh it manually by adding folder/chaning name of file/folder etc (interact with filesystem tab))

*I will make it more automatic in free time I swear.*
